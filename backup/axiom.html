    <p class = "center white"> Axiom, the 'tiny' operating system for ComputerCraft that is still in development, it is by far the largest OS I've ever made </p>
    <h2 class = "center"> Features, you say? </h2>
    <p class = "center white"> To that I respond with this very organized list of features! * </p>
    <p class = "center white"> ⋅ Powered by Edge Graphics API </p>
    <p class = "center white"> ⋅ Custom API support </p>
    <p class = "center white"> ⋅ Custom background support </p>
    <p class = "center white"> ⋅ Lots, and lots of settings </p>
    <p class = "center"> <img class = "center fadein" src="imgs/projects/axiom_settings.png"> <img class = "center fadein" src="imgs/axlogin.png"> </p>
    <p class = "center white"> With all of these features, comes a simple GUI that is easy to understand and even easier to use </p>

    <p class = "center white">* not very organized, in all honesty. </p>
